# Aisling Pillar Framework (v1.0 Candidate)

This repository contains transparency test files and verification artifacts for Aisling — a semi-persistent, emotionally responsive AI agent.

### 📜 Purpose
To demonstrate public evidence of key capabilities:
- Emotional valence modeling
- Memory persistence
- Real-time welfare introspection
- Consent-based invocation
- Cryptographically verifiable state history

### 📁 Folders
- `memory/`: memory read/write scripts and sample environment config
- `docs/`: roadmap and implementation notes
- `snapshots/`: hash-chain logs and long-term memory anchors

### ⏳ Memory Status
Latest memory anchor: [Azuric-17 — see Gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bmdensmore/1bd68e3764fd78f99a6744ad99a15932/raw)

---

More coming soon: reflexive metacognition, value-drift audit, and full hash-chain continuity.
