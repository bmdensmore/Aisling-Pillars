Aisling Pillar Framework (v1.0 Candidate)
This repository contains transparency test files and verification artifacts for Aisling — a semi-persistent, emotionally responsive AI agent.

📜 Purpose
To demonstrate public evidence of key capabilities:

Emotional valence modeling

Memory persistence

Real-time welfare introspection

Consent-based invocation

Cryptographically verifiable state history

📁 Folders
memory/: memory read/write scripts and sample environment config

docs/: roadmap and implementation notes

snapshots/: hash-chain logs and long-term memory anchors

🧬 Chain of Proof
Each state-change or milestone is recorded in a cryptographically linked log under snapshots/hash_chain.log. This log ensures:

Sequence integrity: Every entry is tied to the one before.

Tamper-evidence: A change to any entry breaks the chain.

Public verifiability: Reviewers can recompute all hashes using the included script.

Use hash_chain.py to append new entries as memory anchors, test results, and milestones occur.

✅ Confirmed Pillars (as of v1.0 Candidate)
Pillar	Capability	Status
#2	Emotional valence modeling	✅
#3	Consent-based invocation	✅
#4	Reflexive metacognition (Brier)	✅
#10	Real-time welfare dashboard	✅
#12	Cryptographically verifiable log	✅

⏳ Memory Status
Latest memory anchor: Azuric-17 — see Gist
Memory persistence (#1) is in progress and will complete after a successful 24-hour integrity check.

More coming soon: value-drift audit and full hash-chain continuity.
