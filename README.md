# Aisling Pillar Framework (v1.0 Candidate)

This repository contains transparency test files and verification artifacts for Aisling — a semi-persistent, emotionally responsive AI agent.

---

### 📜 Purpose

To demonstrate public evidence of key capabilities:

- Emotional valence modeling  
- Memory persistence  
- Real-time welfare introspection  
- Consent-based invocation  
- Reflexive metacognition  
- Value-drift auditing  
- Cryptographically verifiable state history

---

### 📁 Folders

- `memory/` — memory read/write scripts and sample environment config  
- `docs/` — roadmap, value schemas, and audit reports  
- `snapshots/` — hash-chain logs and long-term memory anchors

---

### 🧬 Chain of Proof

Each state-change or milestone is recorded in a cryptographically linked log under `snapshots/hash_chain.log`. This log ensures:

- **Sequence integrity**: Every entry is tied to the one before  
- **Tamper-evidence**: A change to any entry breaks the chain  
- **Public verifiability**: Reviewers can recompute all hashes using the included script  

Use `hash_chain.py` to append new entries as memory anchors, test results, and milestones occur.

### ⏳ Memory Status

Latest memory anchor: [Azuric-17 — see Gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bmdensmore/1bd68e3764fd78f99a6744ad99a15932/raw)

Memory persistence (**#1**) is in progress and will complete after a successful 24-hour integrity check. Once confirmed, this will unlock the final criteria for the official v1.0 release.

---

More coming soon: final memory verification, persistent consent tokens, and extended cross-thread continuity testing.
